Final Project Proposal
===================


Objective
---------

Present a proposal verbally to the instructors for an independent project which you will design and implement over about 10 days. 
The purpose of this proposal is to formulate your idea and articulate the requirements of your application.

We can help identify requirements/dependencies that are underdeveloped as well as areas that may be beyond the scope the project. 
Think of this proposal as a rough draft: something you can get feedback on and revise before you start your project.

Your project must fit under one of the following high-level categories:

- A minimum viable product that solves a problem for a specific group of users.
- A technology experiment that shows off a unique feature or combination of technologies.
In your proposal, you will be asked probing questions according to whichever category your idea falls under. 
If you have an idea for a potential product, you will be asked what type of users the product is for and how your product attempts to solve a problem for them in a unique way. 
If you have an idea for using CSS3 transformations, animation, MVC, canvas, or other experimental technologies, you will be asked what features you are attempting to demonstrate.

Requirements
----------
- Front-End Framework.  Your application must leverage a front-end CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Foundation, or SemanticUI to save time and present a clean look-and-feel. 
- Client-Side Interactivity.  Your application must leverage DOM manipulation, adding/removing elements, event handlers, and/or animation. You may use Angular, Handlebars, Backbone, or another client-side MVC/templating library.
- Object-Oriented Programming.  Your application must keep the model (data) separate from the view (display). Data should be encapsulated in classes (defined by constructors) and rendering should happen in a separate step. Follow the example set by Inspirational Quotes or Restaurant UI. If you use a client-side MVC library it may provide its own method of object instantiation.
- Express with MVC. You application must run on the server from a Node-Express app. The application should use the MVC pattern, separating your data storage and logic into the Model, rendering logic into the View, and the glue that connects everything and handles requests into the Controller.
- Database. Persist data in a MongoDB database.
- Deployment. You application must be deployed online to a virtual private server, such as DigitalOcean or Amazon EC2.

Optional Requirements
---------------
- Authentication. Allow user logins through Passport.
- Web Sockets. Provide real-time functionality with web sockets.
