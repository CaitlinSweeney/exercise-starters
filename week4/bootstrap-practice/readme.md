Bootstrap Practice
=============

Objective
--------
Using bootstrap, build some of their example templates without looking at the source of the template. Try to recreate each one listed below as closely as possible.

Skills
-----------
- HTML
- Bootstrap

Resources
----------
- <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
- <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples">Bootstrap Example Templates</a>

Requirements
----------
- Build the "Jumbotron" example.
- Build the "Justified Nav" example. Note that the actual styling of the navbar (the gradient, borders, etc) is defined in a non-bootstrap stylesheet. Don't worry about the visual appearance as long as they are side-by-side!
- Build the "Carousel" example.
- Make sure that each of your builds matches the responsiveness of the example!
